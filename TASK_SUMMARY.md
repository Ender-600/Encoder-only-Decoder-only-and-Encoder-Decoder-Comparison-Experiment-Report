- Professional styling with shadows and rounded corners

#### Abstract Section 📝
- Comprehensive summary highlighting three key phenomena:
  1. **The Generality Tax** (5×-10× energy cost)
  2. **The KV-Cache Bottleneck** (OOM at 4K tokens)
  3. **Sample Inefficiency** (2× convergence difference)
- Optimized typography for academic readability

#### Methodology Section 🔬
- **E³ Framework** explained with three gradient cards:
  - ⚡ **Efficiency** (Throughput, Latency, Context Scaling)
  - 🔋 **Energy** (Power, Total Energy, Carbon Footprint)
  - 🎯 **Effectiveness** (Performance, Convergence, Generalization)

#### Results Section 📊
Three experiments with visualizations and insights:

1. **Experiment 1: The Cost of Generality**
   - Bar chart comparing energy consumption
   - Insight: "Generative classification is computationally expensive"
   - Shows 8.7× energy difference

2. **Experiment 2: The Context Stress Test**
   - Line graph showing VRAM growth
   - Insight: "Decoder-only models hit OOM at 4K tokens"
   - Demonstrates the KV-cache bottleneck

3. **Experiment 3: Training Convergence**
   - Loss curves comparison
   - Insight: "Encoder inductive bias leads to 2× faster convergence"
   - Shows training efficiency differences

#### Key Takeaways Section 💡
Four-quadrant summary with recommendations:
- 🏆 Best for Production NLU (Encoder-only)
- 🚀 Best for Versatility (Decoder-only)
- ⚖️ Best for Balanced Workloads (Encoder-Decoder)
- 🌍 Sustainability Matters

#### BibTeX Section 📚
- Pre-formatted citation for 2025
- Copy-to-clipboard button (fully functional)

#### SEO & Metadata 🔍
- Open Graph tags (Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Twitter Card metadata
- Google Scholar indexing tags
- Structured JSON-LD data
